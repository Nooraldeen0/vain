        <h2>Lost</h2>
        <p>I knew from the beginning that staying near you would bring me nothing but losses and regrets, yet I moved on without caring about the consequences, and here  Now I'm standing in the middle of the road, I can't get close to you, not even get away.</p>

        <h2>Worthless</h2>
        <p>The night kills the day, flowers wither, colors fade, only black remains , the earth dies, the seas dry up, the snow melts, and the fire goes out. Don’t grieve over that which is dead, gone or lost, go along this path which is full of the blood of warriors and swords of heroes. </p>

        <h2>Give up</h2>
        <p>In the end, I wasn't the one who picked the roses. I guess Looking from afar is now enough for me, I was a little ink splattered on a paper when the writer was writing a story. It was a limitless slope, pain after pain. It's like loss of appetite but towards the world. </p>
